RECIPE

Place 100g of pork belly, sliced into 5mm thick strips, into a cold skillet over medium heat.
Cook the pork until the fat renders out and the pork crisps up.
At the same time place a dashi packet into a saucepan along with 500ml of cold water.
Bring the water to a boil, remove the packet, then add in 200g of tteok (korean rice cakes).
After 3-5 minutes, or when the rice cakes are soft and chewy but not mushy, strain them out, reserving the dashi, and add them in with the pork belly.
Stir to coat in pork fat, and allow them to crisp up slightly if desired.
Now, in a bowl combine 6 egg yolks, 60g of grated pecorino romano cheese, cracked black pepper to taste, and a few pinches of gochugaru (korean chili flake).
Mix well, then add 75ml of the dashi, and continue mixing till a smooth sauce forms.
Pour the sauce into the pan with the pork and rice cakes, and stir to coat.
Add extra dashi if the sauce is too thick.
Serve immediately with extra cheese and gochugaru.
