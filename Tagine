INGREDIENTS

500g Chicken
2 Cloves Garlic, minced
1/2 Onion, minced
1/2 Onion, sliced
1 Tomato, diced
1 Zucchini, cut into spears
1 Carrot, cut into spears
3 Red Potatoes, sliced
1 Bell Pepper, sliced in rings
1 Handful Parsley, chopped
Olives
1tsp Ground Ginger
1tsp Turmeric
1tsp Paprika
1tsp Cumin
1tsp Cayenne

RECIPE

Add 30ml of Olive Oil to a dutch oven or pot over medium heat.
Once shimmering, add 1/2 a diced onion, 2 cloves minced garlic, and a diced tomato, and sauté until soft.
Create a spice blend of equal parts turmeric, ginger, cumin, cayenne, and paprika. Add 60ml of Olive oil and mix well.
Pour half of the mix into the pot and mix so the aromatics are coated.
Place 500g of chicken in the center of the pot, then layer the vegetables on top, forming a tee-pee or cone shape, with the densest vegetables on the bottom.
1 Carrot cut into spears first, then 3 sliced red potatoes, 1 zucchini sliced into spears, followed by a bell pepper cut into rings, half an onion also cut into rings, and a tomato cut into slices.
Sprinkle a handful of chopped parsley on top, then drizzle on the other half of the spice mix.
Garnish with as many olives as you like (they lend a nice briny note to the dish).
Cover the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, and let cook for 45min or until the chicken is fully cooked.
