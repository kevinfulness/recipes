500g Pork
3L Water
1 Onion, diced
3 Carrots, diced
30ml Mustard
2 Sprigs Marjoram

RECIPE

Pour 500g of dried split peas into a large bowl along with 1.5 L of water.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Transfer the peas to a large pot along with their soaking liquid and another 1.5 liters of water.
Bring to a boil, and skim the thick foam that forms on top. There will be a lot. Do not be alarmed.
Once the soup is reasonably clear of foam, add 500g of pork shoulder, along with a diced onion and 3 diced carrots.
Season with salt & pepper, and two sprigs of fresh marjoram.
Reduce to low, cover, and simmer for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, remove the pork from the soup, and cut into 1cm dice.
Return the pork to the soup, add 30ml of mustard, and stir to incorporate.
Serve with extra mustard on the side.
