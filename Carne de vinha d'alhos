RECIPE

Start by cutting 1kg of pork shoulder into bite-size pieces.
Place it in a large bowl, season with salt and pepper, and add 2 sprigs each of marjoram and sage
Nestle 5 cloves of smashed garlic amongst the pork, as well as 3 bay leaves.
Add 150ml of white wine vinegar and 250ml of red or white wine. 
The liquds should be enough to cover the pork. If not, add more of each.
Leave to marinate for at least 2 days.

After marinating, add 30g of lard to a pot over medium heat.
Once melted, add the pork, garlic, and marinade.
Cook uncovered for 30min or until the marinade reduces to an oily sludge at the bottom of the pot.
Increase the heat to high and allow the pork to crisp up on all sides.
Serve with boiled potatoes or crusty bread.
