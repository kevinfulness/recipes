Chupe de Pollo Andino

1 Whole Chicken
1 Ear Corn, cut into 2cm rounds
1 Onion, diced
1 Bell Pepper, diced
2 Potatoes, diced
Cream
Cheese
S&P to taste
Cilantro

To get started we'll be making a chicken stock.
Butcher a whole chicken, place it in a pot, and add the stems of a bunch of cilantro and a tablespoon of salt.
Cover with 2 liters of water, bring to a boil, and skim any scum that floats to the surface.
Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 30min or until the chicken is fully cooked.
Remove the chicken and cilantro stems from the pot, and set the chicken aside to cool.
To a sauté pan over medium high heat, add 2Tbsp of olive oil.
Once the oil comes to temperature add a diced onion, 2 diced bell peppers, and 4 minced scallions.
Sauté until soft, then add the mixture to the chicken broth.
Add in 2 diced potatoes, 1 ear of corn cut into 2cm rounds, and the kernels of 2 ears of corn.
Remove the skin from the cooled chicken, then shred the meat into bite sized pieces and add them to the pot.
Season with salt and pepper to taste, and simmer for 10min until the potatoes are cooked.
Serve and garnish with 70ml cream, 30g of diced fresh cheese, and a few cilantro leaves.
