Recipe

Soak 1kg of wheat berries in water for at least 4 hrs, preferrably overnight.
Place 1kg of bone-in chicken into a large pot.
Cover with water and bring to a boil.
Skim the foam, then add salt, 1tsp cardamom powder, whole cardamom, whole cloves, black peppercorns, cinnamon sticks.
Allow to boil for 15min.
Remove the spices and add the soaked, drained wheat berries, and a couple tablespoons of ghee.
Simmer until the wheat berries "ripen".
Remove the chicken, debone it, shred it finely, and add it back in.
Serve with a drizzle of ghee.
