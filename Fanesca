INGREDIENTS

500g Baccalao
500g Pumpkin, chopped
200g Zucchini, chopped
200g Cabbage, chopped
200g Cooked Rice
1 Onion, diced
3-5 Cloves Garlic, minced
200g Queso Fresco
100g Cream Cheese
1L Milk
60g Butter
1 Hard Boiled Egg
Cilantro
1 Avocado, sliced
1 Plantain, sliced
2 Ears Corn Kernels
150g Kidney Beans
150g Chickpeas
150g Lima Beans
100g Roasted Peanuts
2tsp Cumin
2tsp Paprika
1tsp Oregano



Soak the bacalao in water overnight. To get a head start on desalination, rinse it a few times first until the water runs mostly clear. Change the water every 6 hours while soaking to ensure proper desalination. This stuff is literally salt cured, so be forewarned.
If using dried beans, soak them overnight as well, then boil for 2 hours or until tender.
Peel and chop a small pumpkin or kabocha (about 500g), into cubes. Place it in a pot along with two chopped zucchini (about 200g), cover with water, and bring to a boil.
Boil until soft, about 10min.
Strain, then add to a food processor along with 200g of chopped cabbage and 200g of cooked rice.
Puree until smooth, adding the pumpkin cooking water to thin it out if necessary. Set aside.
Next, puree 100g of peanuts in 250ml of milk.
Melt 60g of butter in a large pot over medium heat.
Once melted, add a diced onion and 3-5 cloves of minced garlic.
Sauté until fragrant, then add 2tsp each of cumin and paprika, and 1tsp of dried oregano.
Mix and allow the spices to toast for a minute before adding in both purees.
Add cooked or fresh beans –- 150g each of kidney beans, chickpeas, and lima beans – as well as 100g each of corn and peas.
Mix well bring to a simmer, and let cook for 15minutes.
In the meantime, shred or chop the bacalao and simmer it in milk for 10min.
Add the fish and milk to the soup, along with 200g of cubed queso fresco, and 100g of cream cheese.
Mix well and allow the cheese to melt.
Season with salt, pepper, and chopped cilantro.
Serve topped with half a hard boiled egg, fried sweet plantains, and sliced avocado.
