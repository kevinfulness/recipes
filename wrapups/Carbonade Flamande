Wow, this is so hearty, the beef is so tender after stewing for so long, 

the spices from the bread have transferred to the stew, 

and the beer balances and rounds out those sharp flavors into something special.

So now that it's getting cold out I hope you give this a try, and let me know 

in the comments if you do, and how it turns out.

See you next time, Cheers
