Zelnik Wrapup


Flaky crispy crust

That deep oniony flavor from the leeks

A bit of salt and creaminess from the cheese

And the eggs bind that all together in a way that

almost reminds me of a quiche


You've got to try this one â€“

the dough is fool proof

and the filling takes all of 10min

no excuses

I wanna see you in the comments telling me

how much you loved it.

See you next time

cheers
