So taking the main ingredients at face value did not

prepare me for this tagine. The chicken carried those

spices through to the final dish, so it's got a definite

North African flair, even as 1970s Midwest the rest of this

casserole seems.

And the melted cream cheese adds a whole different dimension â€“

a creaminess that binds everything together.

So I hope you give this one a try, and if you do, let me know 

how it turns out.

See you next time, cheers.
