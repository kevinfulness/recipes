kõrvitsavorm

Between the savory sauteed mushrooms and bacon,
the pumpkin spice notes of the nutmeg and clove,
and the rich and creamy boiled pumpkin,
this is basically Autumn in a casserole.
So if you're sick of candied yams, I'd recommend
you replace them with kõrvitsavorm this Thanksgiving.
See you next time
Cheers
