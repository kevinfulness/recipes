Oh man, this pizza has all the flavors of Korean Barbecue 

combined with the joy of a pizza. 

The marinated pork and peppers come through with some sweet heat

the kimchi balances that out with some bright acidic tang

and the crust is chewy and beautifully fermented if I can say so myself

So if you're in for an adventure give this one a try, and let me know how it turns out.

See you next time, cheers
