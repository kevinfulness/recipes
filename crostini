3 Crostini

Ingredients

35g Fresh Basil
10g Pine Nuts
50g Parmigiano Reggiano
1 Sardine Filet, canned in olive oil
200g Mushrooms, minced
45g Kalamata Olives, minced
2-3 Cloves Garlic, minced
75ml Olive Oil
1 Bunch Fresh Oregano
Dried Figs, thinly sliced
Honey
1L Whole Milk
100ml Heavy Cream
30ml White Vinegar


Directions

For the Pesto

Into a Food Processor add 10g pine nuts, 25g Parmigiano Reggiano, 35g Basil, a few pinches of salt, and 75ml of extra virgin olive oil. Puree until a smooth paste forms. Taste and add oil, salt or parm to adjust consistency and seasoning.


For the Ricotta

In a saucepan, slowly heat 1L of whole milk and 100ml of cream to 90°C/195°F, stirring occasionally.
As soon as that temperature is reached, stir in 20ml of white vinegar, remove the pot from the heat, and let sit for 15-20min.
After that time, the curds should have separated from the whey. 
Pour the contents of the pot through a strainer, and let strain for 15-60min. The longer it sits, the firmer it will be.
Note that it will firm up when refrigerated.
Transfer to a container, season with salt, mix, and refrigerate until needed (or eat right away).


For the Mushroom Tapenade

Add 200g of minced mushrooms to a saucepan along with 50ml of water.
Simmer, stirring, until the water is evaporated, then add 30ml of olive oil.
Add 1-2 cloves of minced garlic, and a few leaves of fresh oregano, and sauté until fragrant.
Add 45g minced kalamata olives, season with pepper, and sauté for 5min.
Transfer to a container and refrigerate until needed. Optionally puree in a food processor along with extra olive oil for a smoother texture.


Assembling the Crostini

Slice a baguette along the bias, into 1cm slices.
Brush with olive oil and toast until golden.
Top a few with a few tablespoons of pesto, a canned sardine filet, and some freshly grated parmigiano reggiano.
Top a few with olive tapenade, an oregano leaf, and some freshly grated parmigiano reggiano.
Top the remaining crostini with fresh ricotta, thinly sliced dried figs, and a drizzle of honey.
