To make the filling, sauté 300g of diced cremini mushrooms in 50ml of water, until the water evaporates.
Add 30ml of olive oil, and continue to sauté until the mushrooms take on color.
Add 3-5 cloves of minced garlic and a diced onion, and sauté until softened and fragrant.
Drain, rinse, and add 2 jars of chopped artichoke hearts, about 500g, and one 150g jar of chopped green olives.
Season with salt, pepper, and the leaves from two sprigs of thyme.
Cook for a few minutes until some of the liquid has evaporated, then remove from the heat and let cool.
Once cool, add 4 beaten eggs, 100g of chopped blue cheese or other sharp cheese, and 100g of grated gruyere or other melty cheese.
Mix well and set aside.
Soak six sheets of matzo in water for a few seconds until slightly softened, then remove to a paper towel.
Oil a casserole dish, then place two sheets of soaked matzo at the bottom.
Spread a thin layer of the artichoke cheese filling on top of the matzo.
Place another couple sheets of matzo on top, then add more filling on top.
Finally add two more sheets of matzo on top, and sprinkle some more grated gruyere on top of that.
Place the casserole in a preheated 175°C/350°F oven for 20-25min or until heated through and crisped on top.
