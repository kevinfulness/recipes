RECIPE 

In a large pot or dutch oven, heat 30ml of oil over medium heat.
Add 10g of minced ginger, and sauté until fragrant.
Add 8 minced shishito chilies and one sliced thai chili for extra heat.
Once softened and infused into the oil, add 150g of finely minced pork belly.
Fry until the fat renders out and the meat is well browned.
Next add 2 diced Japanese scallions, aka negi, two stalks of diced celery, and 200g of diced daikon for sweetness.
Add 15ml of sesame oil, season with salt, and 2tsp of sansho pepper.
Sauté until the moisture evaporates, then add in 500g of ground lamb.
Brown the lamb, breaking up the mince into small granules, then add in 200ml of dry sake. 
Simmer for 15min until the wine reduces, then add 30ml of tomato paste.
Mix well so everything is coated, then add 300ml of crushed tomatoes, 6 minced shiso leaves, and 150ml of dashi.
Mix and simmer for 2hrs.

Boil 2 servings of chukamen noodles as per their instructions.
Strain, and add to a pan with 2 scoops of the ragu.
Stir to coat the noodles, then serve in a bowl topped with grated parmigiano, thinly sliced negi greens, and a 6.5 minute soft boiled egg.
