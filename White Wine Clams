White Wine Clams

INGREDIENTS

12 Clams per person
250ml White Wine
200g Cherry Tomatoes
1 Shallot, finely minced
4 Cloves Garlic, minced
1 Sprig Fresh Oregano
1tsp Red Pepper Flakes
60g Butter
30ml Olive Oil



RECIPE

Add 30ml of olive oil to a sauté pan over medium heat.
Once the oil is shimmering, add a finely minced shallot, 4 cloves of minced garlic, and a teaspoon of chili flakes.
Sauté for a few minutes until the shallots soften, then add 200g (a heaping cup) of cherry tomatoes.
Cover the pan, and cook for 5 minutes until the tomatoes start breaking down.

In the meantime, slice a baguette into 1cm slices along the bias. Brush both sides with oil, then toast until crispy.

Add 12 clams per person and 250ml of dry white wine to the pan.
Raise the heat to medium high, cover, and steam the clams for 5-10min or until the clams open.
Some clams may take a while to open up, so remove the open ones to a bowl while the rest finish cooking.
If any clams don't open after 10min, discard them.
Once all the clams have been removed from the pan, add 60g of butter to the pan and allow it to melt.
Season with salt & pepper, stir to incorporate, then pour the sauce over the clams.
Garnish with fresh oregano and parsley, and serve with the toasted crostini for dunking.
