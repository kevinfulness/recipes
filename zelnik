3 Leeks, chopped
200g Feta, crumbled
150g Ricotta
2 Eggs
500g Flour
10g Salt
10g Sugar
7g Yeast
15ml Oil
Melted Butter


Start by mixing the dough.
Into the bowl of a stand mixer, place 500g of flour.
Season with 10g of salt,  and 10g of sugar. Add 7g of active dry yeast, and 15ml of oil.
Add 350ml of water for a 50% hydration dough.
Mix and knead the dough with your hook attachment for 5min. Alternatively knead by hand for 10min.
Roll the dough into a log, then divide into 16 equal pieces, roll into balls, coat in oil and set aside to rise for 1hr.

For the filling sauté 3 chopped leeks in a little oil until soft. A pinch of salt will help draw out the excess moisture, but no other seasoning is necessary.
Remove the leeks to a bowl, crack in two eggs, then mix in 200g of crumbled feta, and 150g of ricotta or other creamy mild cheese.

Now to assemble the pie, press out the dough balls into 2mm thick rounds. Drizzle a small amount of melted butter on top of one, and layer another on top.
Now roll out the stacked dough as thin as possible, and as wide as a round sheet pan. Repeat this process with the rest of the pairs of dough balls.
Drape one sheet into your sheet pan, then drizzle some butter inside. Drape another sheet on top, then repeat with two more layers.
Once you have 4 sheets stacked with butter in between, spread your filling thinly around the pie.
Drape the remaining layers on top of the filling, with drizzled butter between each layer, then trim the excess.
Close the edge of the pie by pinching the dough and twisting it over on itself. Try not to overwork the edges or they'll be dense and won't puff up.

Finally drizzle some butter on top of the final layer, and bake the pie for 30min at 200°C or until golden brown.
