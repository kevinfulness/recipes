500g Chicken Breast
1 Onion, diced 
3 Cloves Garlic, minced
5 Potatoes, Diced
1 Handful Parsley, minced
1 Handful Cilantro, minced
5 Eggs
2tsp Hararat consisting of:
White Pepper
Cloves
Nutmeg
Cinnamon
Cardamom
225g Cream Cheese 
250ml Shredded Cheese
Salt & Pepper


In a pot, heat some olive oil over medium high heat, and add in a diced onion.
Sauté until soft and translucent, and add 3 cloves of minced garlic. 
Once they're fragrant, add 500g of cubed chicken breast along with 2 teaspoons of a spice blend called hararat.
My version is a mix of equal parts white pepper, cardamom powder, clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
Mix in thorougly, add 125ml of water, bring to a boil, and let cook for 10min until the chicken is fully cooked.
Remove the chicken out to a bowl to cool, and once cooled add 5 diced potatoes, a chopped handful each of parsley and cilantro, salt, and pepper.
Crack in 5 eggs, along with 225g of cream cheese, and 250ml of shredded mozzarella.
Mix thoroughly, transfer to a baking dish, and top with more shredded cheese.
Bake in a preheated 190°C/375°F oven until the cheese forms a crispy crust.
