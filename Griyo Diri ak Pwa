RECIPE:

Ingredients
1 kgs Pork Shoulder cut into 3cm cubes
1 Cup Dry Kidney Beans
2 Cups Jasmine Rice
Juice of 2 Limes
Juice of 1 Orange
250ml Coconut Milk
1tsp White Wine Vinegar
1/2 Onion, sliced
1/2 Onion, diced
1 Shallot, quartered
5 Cloves Garlic, minced
5 Whole Cloves
4 Sprigs Thyme
2 Bouillon Cubes
1 Scotch Bonnet, sliced in half
1 Scotch Bonnet, minced
Salt & Pepper
Oil for Frying
30g Butter

Cut 1kg of Pork Shoulder into 3cm cubes.
Make a marinade with the juice of 2 limes, the juice of 1 orange, 1tsp of white wine vinegar, 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1 quartered shallot, 2 sprigs of thyme, 3 cloves, a bouillon cube, a minced habanero or scotch bonnet, and some black pepper.
Mix the pork with the marinade, and place in fridge for at least 4 hours, preferrably overnight.

Rinse 1 Cup of Dry Kidney Beans, place them in a large pot, cover with 2L of water, and bring to a boil.
Cook, covered, for an hour.

After an hour, add 500ml of water, then continue to cook for another 20min.
Drain the beans, reserving their liquid.
Add a few tablespoons of oil to the bottom of a pot, and over a medium flame, sauté half a diced onion.
Once translucent add 2 cloves of minced garlic, and sauté until fragrant.
Add the cooked beans, a few pinches of salt, and a bouillon cube.
Mix until the cube dissolves, then add 1 liter of the reserved cooking liquid, as well as 250ml of coconut milk, 30g butter, 2 whole cloves, 2 sprigs of thyme, and a halved habanero or scotch bonnet pepper.
Bring to a boil, then add 2 cups of Jasmine Rice.
Stir and bring back to a boil, then cover and cook for 15minutes.

Oil the bottom of a pot, set over medium-low heat, add the pork and marinade, and cook covered until the pork is tender – at least an hour.
Remove the pork, clean off any extraneous remnants of the marinade, and fry in oil until golden brown.

Serve over rice.
