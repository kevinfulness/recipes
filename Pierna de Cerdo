Ingredients
3kg Pork Shoulder
2 Onions, rougly chopped
2 Celery stalks, chopped
2 Carrots, chopped
1 Head of Garlic, peeled
1 tsp Oregano
2 Sprigs Rosemary
3tsp of salt
1tsp Pepper
250ml Orange Juice
500ml Cola

Recipe:

Prep a pork shoulder by removing any skin and excess fat, then placing scores across the meat 2cm apart.
In a food processor create a marinade by combining a roughly chopped onion, a whole head of peeled garlic, a teaspoon of dried oregano, the leaves of two sprigs of rosemary, 30ml of mustard, 250ml of orange juice, salt and pepper.
Blend until smooth, being sure to taste for balance of flavor – adding more of any ingredient that's lacking.
Transfer the pork to a large bowl, and pour the marinade on top, making sure to spread it into the scores.
Cover with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.

In the bottom of a roasting tray, place a roughly chopped onion, two chopped sticks of celery, and two chopped carrots.
Place the marinated pork on top, or preferrably on a wire rack suspended above the tray, and pour the remaining marinade on top.
Cover with foil and roast in a 175°C/350°F oven for 1hr per kilogram of meat.

After 30 minutes, baste the roast with the drippings and marinade, as well as 100ml of cola. 
Repeat this process until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 68°C/155°F.
Remove from the oven and let rest for 10min before carving and serving.
