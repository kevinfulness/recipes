RECIPE

Into a bowl, add 45g of chopped basil leaves, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 100g of grated parmigiano reggiano, 1L of milk, and 200ml of heavy cream.
Bring a pot with 500ml of water to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and place the bowl of milk on top.
Stir regularly until the milk approaches a simmer – about 90°C/200°F – then remove the bowl and set aside to cool.
Toast 30g of pine nuts in a skillet over low heat, constantly stirring until golden brown, then remove and chop.
Slice a baguette into 5mm slices along the bias. Brush with olive oil, and toast until golden and crispy.
Once the milk mixture is cool enough to handle, plunge the bowl into a bowl of ice water, and stir until it cools down fully.
Strain the mixture into the frozen cylinder of your ice cream maker, and add in the pine nuts.
Follow your ice cream maker's instructions to achieve creamy gelato.
Once frozen, scoop onto the toasted baguette and top with chopped pine nuts, shaved parmigiano, and fresh basil.
