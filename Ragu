INGREDIENTS

500g Beef Short Rib
200g Beef Top Round, sliced thin
4 Italian Sausages
300ml Red Wine
1.5L Crushed Tomatoes
60ml Tomato Paste
20g Parmigiano Reggiano, chopped
2 Cloves Garlic, minced
1 Clove Garlic, sliced
5-10 Parsley Leaves
5 Basil Leaves
30ml Olive Oil


RECIPE

For the braciola/involtino, roll a clove of sliced garlic, 20g of chopped parmigiano reggiano, and a few leaves of fresh parsley in a thin-cut slice of beef (top round works best, but flank will do in a pinch).
Truss the roll in kitchen twine and set aside.
Heat 30ml of olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat.
Once shimmering, add 500g of short rib, a few italian sausages, and the braciola. Sear on each side until a nice brown crust forms.
Remove the meat to a plate, then add half a diced onion and two cloves of minced garlic to the pot.
Sauté until translucent and fragrant, then add the meat back to the pot.
Add 60ml of tomato paste and 300ml of red wine, then stir the meat until it's coated.
Add two 28oz cans (about 1.5L) of crushed tomatoes, then rinse the cans with water and add that in (about 200ml).
Season with 10g of salt, add 5 fresh basil leaves, then reduce the heat to low, cover partially, and simmer for 5 hours.

Serve the sauce over rigatoni as a first course, and serve the meat as the main course along with a vegetable (Sautéd asparagus goes well).
