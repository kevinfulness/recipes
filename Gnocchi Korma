Gnocchi Korma, sage butter

500g Potatoes
150g Flour
1 Egg
1 Onion, sliced
3 Cloves Garlic, minced
1 Knob Ginger, minced
3 Green Chillies, sliced
1 Cinnamon Stick
5 Cloves
3 Cardamom Pods
5g Cumin Seeds
3 Bay Leaves
115g Butter
40g Clarified butter
5g Chili powder
5g Turmeric Powder
125ml Yogurt
250ml Cashews
8 Sage Leaves


RECIPE


To get started with the korma, melt 40g of clarified butter in a sauté pan over medium heat.
Once melted add a stick of cinnamon, 5-8 cloves, 3 bay leaves, 3 cardamom pods, and 5g each of cumin seeds and coriander seeds, and sauté until fragrant.
Add a sliced onion and sweat until soft and translucent, adding 75ml of water if too dry.
Next, add 30g each of minced garlic and ginger, as well as 3 sliced green thai chilies, and sauté until fragrant.
Remove the bay leaves and cinnamon stick, then add 5g each of kashmiri chili powder (or paprika), and ground turmeric.
Season with 5g salt, and add 125ml of yogurt, and mix thoroughly, adding a bit of water if needed to aid distribution.
Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor along with 250ml of cashews, and puree until smooth.
Optionally run the puree through a sieve for a smooth texture.
Set aside or refrigerate for up to 3 days.

For the gnocchi, bring 500g of diced, peeled russet (or similar) potatoes to a boil for 10min.
Strain the potatoes, then mash them with a fork, potato masher, or ricer.
Add 150g of flour and an egg, and mix thoroughly until a soft dough forms. Add flour if the dough is still wet.
Divide into 8 equal pieces, then roll each piece into a 1.5cm thick rectangle with a rolling pin.
Trim the edges with a knife, then cut into 1.5cm cubes. 
They probably won't be perfectly cubic, but the shape will be sufficiently different from a regular gnocco that it will still be unexpected and impressive.
Boil the gnocchi for a couple minutes, until floating, in a pot of well-salted water, then strain and set aside.

Melt a stick (115g) of butter in a frying pan over medium heat. 
Stir while melting until the butter stops foaming and sizzling and the color changes to golden brown.
Add 3 sage leaves per serving, and sauté until wilted. Remove and set aside.
Add the boiled gnocchi to the brown butter, increase the heat to medium-hi, and fry on all sides until golden and crispy.
At the same time, bring 100ml of korma per serving up to temperature in a skillet over medium heat.
Transfer the gnocchi to the korma, and coat well.

Plate 100ml of korma in a bowl, add 6 gnocchi, top with 3 crispy sage leaves, and drizzle brown butter around the perimeter.
