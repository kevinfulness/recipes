RECIPE
Peel and chop a medium-sized pumpkin into 1cm cubes.
Bring 2 liters of water to a boil in a large pot, season with salt, and add the pumpkin.
Boil for 10 minutes until the pumpkin is tender, then drain and let cool.

To make the filling, bring 100ml of water to a boil in a sauté pan, and add in 300g of diced mushrooms. 
Cook until the water evaporates, then add 30ml of olive oil.
Add in 1 diced onion and sauté until transparent.
Add in 2 cloves of minced garlic and sauté until fragrant.
Add 150g of diced smoked ham or bacon, and sauté until the mushrooms and ham have taken on some color.
Remove and set aside.

Grease a baking dish with butter, add the pumpkin and cooked mushrooms with ham.
Season with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, and a little ground clove, and add 150g of grated gruyere cheese. 
Beat 2 eggs with 50ml of heavy cream and pour over the pumpkin.
Mix thoroughly, then top with some more gruyere, to form a golden crust
Place the dish in a preheated 200C/400F oven for 30min or until a golden crust forms on top.
