RECIPE
Peel and chop a medium pumpkin into 2cm cubes.
Boil in salted water until soft, about 20min. 
Drain and let cool.
In the meantime, bring 125ml of water to a boil in a sauté pan, and add in 300g of diced mushrooms. Cook until the water evaporates, then add 30ml of olive oil.
Add in 1 diced onion and sauté until transparent.
Add in 2 cloves of minced garlic and 150g of diced smoked ham or bacon, and sauté until the mushrooms and ham have taken on some color.
Remove and set aside.
Grease a baking dish with butter, and add the pumpkin, and cooked mushrooms and ham.
Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a little clove, and add 100g of grated gruyere cheese. Mix thoroughly and spread to cover the bottom of the baking dish.
Beat 2 eggs with 50ml of heavy cream and pour over the pumpkin.
Sprinkle some more gruyere on top to form a crust, then place the dish in a preheated 200C oven for 30min or until a golden crust forms on top.
