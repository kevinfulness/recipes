RECIPE

Chop 1kg of pork ribs into 2-4cm pieces. If possible, have your butcher do this.
Place the ribs into a large pot, along with 30g of sliced ginger, 5 scallion greens, and 15ml of Shaoxing Chinese cooking wine.
Cover the ribs with water, bring to a boil, and skim any scum that floats to the surface.
Once the water is clear, remove the ribs from the pot and rinse under cold running water.

Heat a wok or pot over medium low heat and add 60ml of cooking oil.
Add 40g of rock sugar, and stir frequently until the sugar melts into the oil and changes color to a reddish gold color.
Add the ribs, toss in the oil/sugar syrup, and let the ribs brown, stirring frequently to brown all sides.
Once brown, Add 5 dried chillies, 30g sliced ginger,5 peeled cloves of garlic, 5 scallion whites, 2 bay leaves, 2 star anise, 1 tablespoon of sichuan peppercorns, 15ml of doubanjiang, and 15ml of tianmianjiang.
Stir to coat the ribs in the sauces, and allow to fry for a minute or two.
Add 700ml (about two 12oz cans) of beer, preferrably a pilsner or American style lager.
Add 15ml soy sauce, 15ml dark soy sauce, and 15ml of Shaoxing wine, then increase the heat to medium high, cover the wok, and braise for 1hr or until the liquid has reduced to a thick sauce. 
Add a chopped tomato and 2 chopped green chillies, mix well, and serve.
