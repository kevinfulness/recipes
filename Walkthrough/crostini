Sardines & Pesto
Olive Mushroom Tapenade
Ricotta Fichi e Miele


Start with the pesto
You can use store-bought, but it's quick and easy to make your own
I'm making a small portion for this recipe, so I'm using a stick blender but it's the wrong tool for job, so I'd recommend using a Food Processor
And before anyone gets on my case, yes traditional pesto is made in a mortar and pestle, but this is easier, so...

Into your food processor add 1tbsp of pignoli aka pine nuts
a peeled clove of garlic (and if your garlic is a bit old now would be a perfect time to remove the central stem to make it less bitter)
1 Cup of Basil
A few pinches of Salt to help with abrasion
Add 75ml of extra virgin olive oil
Blend
Add 50g of parmigiano reggiano
Keep blending until smooth
give it a taste along the way to check for seasoning.
Refrigerate covered with plastic wrap touching surface to prevent browning

Next let's make some ricotta cheese
Again, you can use store bought, but use whole milk for extra richness and avoid the Whole Foods one because it's an abomonation. 
But really, this is so easy to make, so give it a try if you've got the time.
Now, technically real ricotta is re-cooked whey leftover from the mozzarella making process. But everyone makes it this way, and it tastes amazing.

Into a medium saucepan
1L or half gallon whole Milk (not uht/ultrapasteurized)
100ml Cream
Slowly Bring to 90C/195F – just below simmering
Add 20ml white vinegar
Kill heat
let sit 15min
Strain for 30min
Season with salt
Refrigerate
