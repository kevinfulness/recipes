Xiaopang Walkthrough

I watch a lot of Foodtube, and one of my favorite channels is called Family in Northwest China aka Xiao Pang
She used to post these strangely enticing thumbnails that didn't really give you any idea about what she'd be making, but I'd end up clicking anyway.
These days she's been making a lot of braised meat dishes that look spicy and saucy and delicious, so I figured I'd try out her northern chinese technique and make beer braised pork ribs.

To get started take 1kg of ribs and chop them into 2-4cm pieces. 
If possible have your butcher do this so you don't have to.
Throw them into a pot or wok
Add 30g Ginger
The Whites of 5 Scallions
Cover the ribs with water and add
15ml of Shaoxing Wine
Bring to a Boil
Skim Foam
Take out the ribs and Wash in Cold Water
This first step is meant to reduce the funky taste pork can have.
Not entirely necessary since it'll be covered in sauce, but it's tradition.

Wok over Medium-low
Add 30ml Oil
30g Rock Sugar
Create a Caramel
Once the sugar is melted thoroughly,
Add Ribs, stir to coat, and Brown the Meat

Add 
	5 Dried Chillies
	30g Ginger
	5 Cloves Garlic
	5 Scallion Whites
	2Tbsp Daubanjeong
	2Tbsp Timminjeong
	2 Bay Leaves
	2 Star Anise
	1 Stick Cinnamon
	1Tbsp Sichuan Peppercorns

Toast for a couple minutes	
Add two cans of beer
I'm taking this step from a similar chicken recipe she made, so it may be out of place, but we'll see!

Add
	1Tbsp Light Soy
	1Tbsp Dark Soy
Cover

Braise for 1hr until reduced
