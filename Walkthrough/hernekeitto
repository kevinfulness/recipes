Hey, welcome back
Today I'll be making a split pea soup with pork and ...mustard
It's hernekeitto from Finland

To get started i've got 500g of split peas.
Let's place them in a larger bowl than you think you need
and cover them up with about 1.5 liters of water.
Throw those in the fridge and let them soak overnight.

Now that they've soaked they've just about doubled in size.
Let's throw those in a large pot along with another liter and a
half of water, and bring them to a boil.
As they're heating up you'll see a lot of thick foam floating to
the surface.
Go ahead and skim as much of that off as possible, and once it's 
relatively clear, let's add in some pork. 
I've got 500g of pork shoulder here.
Let's also add in a diced up onion
and one very large diced carrot – you could also opt for 3 smaller
carrots. Not sure what's going on with these carrots I keep getting.
Let's season that with a few good pinches of salt,
some freshly cracked black pepper,
and a couple sprigs of marjoram.
Now stir that all in, reduce the heat to low, and simmer it, covered, for
two hours or more, stirring occasionally.

While that's going, go ahead and subscribe to my channel – I've got
new recipes out every sunday.

After two hours, let's remove the pork, chop it into small dice,
and return it to the soup.
Next we'll add two tablespoons of mustard, stir that in well,
and we're ready to serve. With some extra mustard on the side, of course.
