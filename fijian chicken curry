1 Chicken, skinned & chopped
250g Potatoes, peeled & chopped
1/2 Onion, sliced
3-4 Cloves Garlic, minced
30g Ginger, minced
3g Garam Masala
3g Ground Turmeric
2g Cumin Seed
3g Chili Powder


RECIPE

Get a large pot or dutch oven going over medium high heat, and add 60ml of oil.
Once the oil comes to temperature (it should loosen up and appear to shimmer), add in half a large sliced onion.
Sauté until it starts to turn golden, then add 3-4 cloves of minced garlic and 30g of minced ginger.
Stir to mix, and once those aromatics are fragrant, add 3g (1tsp) of garam masala, 3g of ground turmeric, 3g of chili powder, and 2g (1tsp) of cumin seed.
Mix well and allow the spices to toast for a minute before adding in a whole, skinned chicken, chopped into bite size pieces.
Coat the chicken in the spices, reduce the heat to medium, cover the pot, and let it cook for 10-15min until the chicken is fully cooked.
After that time, a bit of juice should've accumulated at the bottom of the pot. If it's looking dry, feel free to add 50-100ml of water (or more, if you want a soupier curry).
Add 250g of peeled, chopped potatoes, cover the pot, and allow it to cook for another 20min or until the potatoes are cooked through.
Serve over white rice, with a sprinkle of cilantro and a squeeze of lime.
